# Legal Domain RAG System

Welcome to the documentation for the Legal Domain RAG System - a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation system focused on legal documents.

## Overview

The Legal Domain RAG System allows legal professionals to query a corpus of legal documents using natural language and receive accurate, context-aware responses with proper citations to the source material.

### Key Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload and process legal documents (contracts, case law, statutes, regulations)
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant information using advanced semantic search algorithms
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Assemble coherent context from various document sources
- **Response Generation**: Generate accurate responses with proper legal citations
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface designed for legal professionals

## Getting Started

To get started with the Legal Domain RAG System:

1. [Set up your environment](dev/environment.md)
2. [Upload your legal documents](user-guide/document-management.md)
3. [Start querying your documents](user-guide/querying.md)

## System Architecture

```
[Document Sources] → [Ingestion Pipeline] → [Vector Database]
                                            ↑
[Web UI] → [API Gateway] → [Query Processor] → [LLM Service]
```

The system follows a modular architecture with these main components:

- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend API**: FastAPI application
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Extracts, chunks, and embeds documents
- **Vector Database**: Stores document embeddings for semantic search
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to language models for response generation
